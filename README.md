Purpose:
I'm finally back after a long break, I thought it'd be fun to release some previously unfinished projects. This tool for now is just a simple keyword checker for urls. However I will continue to work on it and add new features in the coming months. I will also consider changing to my new CLI menu design I am currently testing out in my Discord Manager repo. I will likely look to start integrating my tools into discord as well feel free to message me at Spartan#0767 with any ideas or questions.
